#
# The idea here is you provide a simulation object that overrides specific
# pieces of WPILib, and modifies motors/sensors accordingly depending on the
# state of the simulation. An example of this would be measuring a motor
# moving for a set period of time, and then changing a limit switch to turn
# on after that period of time. This can help you do more complex simulations
# of your robot code without too much extra effort.
#
# NOTE: THIS API IS ALPHA AND WILL MOST LIKELY CHANGE!
#       ... if you have better ideas on how to implement, submit a patch!
